That is because it so perfectly enumerated the typical arguments in favor of government regulation of AI. Unfortunately, AI is already here and has been for years. The issues the speaker listed were around long before AI and the government did nothing about those issues before AI came into the picture. AI is already being used for war. When we make any attempt to regulate AI, we increase the chance that foreign actors will use it against our country in nefarious ways. AI is just a continuation of everything that came before it, just in a more efficient and rapid way. If the video was a deep fake, it is a good one.
